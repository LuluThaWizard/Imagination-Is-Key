<h1>Creativity And Imagination</h1>
</head></header>

<body> <div align="left"><p> When It comes to creativity, we always tend to use our imagination. When we do so our thinking process tends to expand and seem endless. Especially when it comes to art itself so many ideas come to mind. This is one of the reasons to why I love creativity and imagination things are just endless and you come up with so many ideas. However what better way can you express those ideas? I find the best way is through art itself. You can do so many things with it and express it anyway you want too. That’s why I have created this site Imagination Is Key because I think that if everyone was to express their inner imagination maybe we can create something amazing for the world something different. It’s always good to think outside of the spectrum or the box. You always must picture something before you can create it and most people picture things that others really can’t because our minds are different. </div></p>

<h2>Making Profit Off Art</h2>
<body>When it comes to making something happen it’s not always free it would be great to gain some type of income especially if it’s something that you create. Kind of like music people make music all the time and express their feelings in different ways or sounds. I find art to be the same way as music except there’s no sound its just the picture itself showing you what it is. One of the reasons I made this site was to improve more on getting art out there and showing people that art can be popular too and people can make money off it. Either if it’s just showing an idea or a simple picture its still something that you have created. For some reason I find music more popular than art and so do others but hopefully this site can change the way other views art itself.</body>
